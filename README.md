This is a solo-project based on the public datasets by Olist found in the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terencicp/e-commerce-dataset-by-olist-as-an-sqlite-database).
It's supposed to be a practice project for basic data-analysis and to sharpen my git skills
as well as offer the backbone of a (hopefully) fancy frontend dashboard down the line.
