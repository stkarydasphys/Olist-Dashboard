This is a solo-project based on the public datasets by Olist found in the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terencicp/e-commerce-dataset-by-olist-as-an-sqlite-database).
It's originally supposed to be a practice project for basic data-analysis and to sharpen my git skills
as well as offer the backbone of a (hopefully) fancy frontend dashboard down the line.

I intend for it to not only live inside the notebooks but also be scalable, hence I have been adding
scripts to return the dataframes (or dfs similar to them) that I have used throughout the notebook(s).
I also do some basic regressions to explore and support some of the findings of the EDA
done in the notebooks.

Finally, it includes a basic what-if analysis to increase prodits, based on a billing paradigm proposed by the Le Wagon
bootcamp in the corresponding project we did there.
